init speed 25 mph if speed limit tag != 25, update the value
create a new data type that will be an edge. have index of other node or node id of other node,

for this node, add an edge to this node if its two way, add to both nodes
array of adjaceny lists
need both readers to work, cvs writer to save routes


Vector 'DNodes' of SNode has 
DNodeID
DLat
DLon
 per index
