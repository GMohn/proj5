DNodes is a vector of SNodes. SNodes get populated with DNodeID,DLat,DLon,DEdges.
DEdges is a vector of SEdge. SEdge is populated with OtherNodeIdx,DDistance,DTime, DMaxSped

DNodes[[ID,Lat,Lon,[OtherNode,Dist,Time,Speed]],[[ID,Lat,Lon,[OtherNode,Dist,Time,Speed]]]

stop_id only matters for joining route to node_id

if we have EType start, and its a way, then keep reading in new entities until ::end of way
vector or something to keep track node ids there are in which order. 
Tags: one way (bool) only true if one way tag and its set to yes
init speed 25 mph if speed limit tag != 25, update the value
create a new data type that will be an edge. have index of other node or node id of other node, 
needs speed limit info and vector of those edges to the node
for this node, add an edge to this node if its two way, add to both nodes
array of adjaceny lists
need both readers to work, cvs writer to save routes

may want a set that keeps track of the route names because of duplicates, and also may want to use a map to go from routename to list of stops.

Vector 'DNodes' of SNode has 
DNodeID
DLat
DLon
 per index
